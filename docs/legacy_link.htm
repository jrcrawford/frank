        you have annuity clients who never intend to personally use the money 
        in their annuities?</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Tax 
        deferred annuities are a great choice for those looking to save for retirement, 
        but very few people ever annuitize their contracts for income or even 
        access the accumulated cash values for personal uses. If this money is 
        intended for heirs, Legacy Link&reg; from Liberty Life Assurance Company 
        of Boston can help them maximize their legacies without burdening beneficiaries 
        with additional income taxes. Unlike the way it&#8217;s been tried in 
        the past, Legacy Link&reg; really makes the annuity rescue concept work 
        by streamlining the underwriting process, the paperwork, and the payments 
        from the annuity to the life insurance. And, if clients are concerned 
        about needing the money if they get sick, Legacy Link&#8217;s&reg; life 
        policy offers penalty free access to cash values for qualifying medical 
        stays and an accelerated death benefit for chronic illnesses (unable to 
        perform 2 ADL&#8217;s). </font></p>
